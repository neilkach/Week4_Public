# Week4_Public

This repository is the PUBLIC repo for students of the 2020 MIT BWSI Medlytics course for Week 2! Most notebooks do not include solutions, and instead has [## YOUR CODE HERE] where students should write their own code.

This repository does not allow pull requests so we recommend you fork this repository and work on your own copy.
